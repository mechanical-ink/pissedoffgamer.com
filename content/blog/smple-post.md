## A Great Game, A Terrible God of War Game

After playing the new installment in the God of War franchise, around 2 years late mind you, i couldn't help finding myself moderately disappointed in this franchises new direction. I'm sure i'm not the only metaphorically graying fan of the God of War of old, that has come to expect a significant amount of brutality, destruction and distractions of the feminine variety that offer a bit more than the exchange of words during conversation, Now i won't be so petty as to say that the lack of the infamous mandatory sex mini-game was the final nail in the coffin, however that cup of sugar would have helped the medicine that is this games story, as well as its attempts at being emotional go down far smoother.

\-A sidetracked look into the past games-

lets talk about depth, Journalists seem to believe that the series of old was just a shallow, cliche revenge story, Kratos was a bloodthirsty animal without personality and due to that, this new installment saved the series. as much as i half-agree with the cliche revenge story argument, the notion that Kratos was nothing but a heartless murder machine and the claim that the newest installment saved the series is complete harpy shit. I urge you to play Chains of Olympus, Ghost of Sparta and Ascension, then make the statement that Kratos is just a bloodthirsty maniac without heart nor soul with a straight face as you recall Kratos reuniting with his daughter in Elysium, the clear conflict in his face when offered the illusion of having his family back as long as he remains a servant of Ares, the classic line "by the gods, what have i become", God of War 2 the scene with the last spartan telling him that Zeus destroyed the last home and family he had left. The more you play these games, the more you see the Greek gods clearly toying with, torturing and controlling Kratos, the more you feel his brutality against the gods becoming justified. You start to see the Kratos in God of War 3 less as the man who kills gods because he can (and because it's fun), but the man who kills gods because they left him no choice. Now for the implication that the new game saved the series, Minotaur shit. The series was over, with all the gods dead and with nothing and nobody left Kratos took his own life, as he attempted to do in the very first scene in the very first game, that has always been how his story was meant to end, with Kratos having the freedom to end his own life, it was the one choice he made for himself and wasn't made for him. A dark and brutal ending to a dark and brutal series.

\-Back to the present-

But now he's back, after running himself through with the blade of olympus he dusted himself off, adopted a more tolerant attitude towards life out of nowhere and started a new family, is anyone actually buying this? I'm not going to hammer on that point because this rant is already looking long enough as is, but come on really?
