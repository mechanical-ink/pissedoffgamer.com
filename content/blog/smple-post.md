## A Great Game, A Terrible God of War Game

After playing the new installment in the God of War franchise, around 2 years late mind you, i couldn't help finding myself moderately disappointed in this franchises new direction. I'm sure i'm not the only metaphorically graying fan of the God of War of old, that has come to expect a significant amount of brutality, destruction and distractions of the feminine variety that offer a bit more than the exchange of words during conversation, Now i won't be so petty as to say that the lack of the infamous mandatory sex mini-game was the final nail in the coffin, however that cup of sugar would have helped the medicine that is this games story, as well as its attempts at being emotional go down far smoother. I keep hearing this notion that the game shines a new light on Kratos, showing off his humanity and that has never been done before. Did we forget God of War Ascension, Ghost of Sparta and Elysium in Chains of Olympus that quickly? Even the original trilogy had scenes showing the humanity in Kratos
