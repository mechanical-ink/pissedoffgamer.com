## God of War 2018 Review

After playing the new installment in the God of War franchise, around 2 years late mind you, i couldn't help finding myself moderately disappointed in this franchises new direction. I'm sure i'm not the only metaphorically graying fan of the God of War of old, that has come to expect a significant amount of brutality, destruction and distractions of the feminine variety that offer a bit more than the exchange of words during conversation, Now i won't be so petty as to say that the lack of the infamous mandatory sex mini-game was the final nail in the coffin, however that cup of sugar would have helped the medicine that is this games story, as well as its attempts at being emotional go down far smoother.

\-A look into the past games-

Speaking of depth in story, Journalists seem to believe that the series of old was just a cliche revenge story, Kratos was a bloodthirsty animal without personality and due to that this new installment saved the series. as much as i half-agree with the cliche revenge story argument, the notion that Kratos was nothing but a heartless murder machine and the claim that the newest installment saved the series is complete harpy shit. I urge you to play Chains of Olympus, Ghost of Sparta and Ascension, then make the statement that Kratos is just a bloodthirsty maniac without heart nor soul with a straight face as you recall Kratos reuniting with his daughter in Elysium, the clear confliction in his face when offered the illusion of having his family back as long as he remains a servant of Ares, the classic line "by the gods, what have i become". The more you play these games, the more you feel Kratos' brutality against the gods become justified, you start to see the Kratos in God of War 3 less as the man who kills gods because he can and it's fun, but the man who kills gods because they left him no choice.
